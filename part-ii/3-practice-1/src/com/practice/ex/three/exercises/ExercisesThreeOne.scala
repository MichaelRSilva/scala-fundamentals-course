  // a) This method answers the question
  def futureDemonstration(): Future[Int] = {
    // Note the use of def (instead of val) which ensures the futures will be started by f1.flatMap and f2.map, which
    // would be the same as using inline futures.

      2
    }

    def f2 = Future {
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      40
    }

    // b) f1 is executed first and f2 after f1 has completed successfully
    // c) println call occurs in f2's thread
    f1.flatMap(n1 => f2.map(n2 => {
      println(n1 + n2)
      n1 + n2
